"A Requirement diagram provides a visualization for requirements and their"

#: ../../requirementDiagram.md:28
msgid ""
"There are three types of components to a requirement diagram: "
"requirement, element, and relationship."
msgstr ""

#: ../../requirementDiagram.md:30
msgid ""
"The grammar for defining each is defined below. Words denoted in angle "
"brackets, such as ```<word>```, are enumerated keywords that have options"
" elaborated in a table. ```user_defined_...``` is use in any place where "
"user input is expected."

#: ../../requirementDiagram.md:32
msgid ""
"An important note on user text: all input can be surrounded in quotes or "
"not. For example, both ```Id: \"here is an example\"``` and ```Id: here "
"is an example``` are both valid. However, users must be careful with "
"unquoted input. The parser will fail if another keyword is detected."
