"A pie chart (or a circle chart) is a circular statistical graphic, which "
"is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie "
"chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle "
"and area), is proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is "
"named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are "
"variations on the way it can be presented. The earliest known pie chart "
"is generally credited to William Playfair's Statistical Breviary of 1801 "
