"The main idea of the API is to be able to call a render function with the"

"and call a callback with the resulting svg code. With this approach it is"

"(perhaps from a textarea), render it and place the graph somewhere in the"
" site."

#: ../../usage.md:226

"Sometimes the generated graph also has defined interactions like tooltip "

#: ../../usage.md:249

"The callback function is called with two parameters, the svg code of the "
"generated graph and a function. This function binds events to the svg "

msgstr ""

#: ../../usage.md:322

"**Alternative to mermaid.parse():** One effective and more future-proof "
