"A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, first developed by Karol Adamiecki "
"in 1896, and independently by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, that illustrates "
"a project schedule and the amount of time it would take for any one "
"project to finish. Gantt charts illustrate number of days between the "
"start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a"
" project."
msgstr ""
"甘特图是一种条形图，最早由 Karol Adamiecki 在 1896 年开发，并由 Henry Gantt 在 1910 "
"年代独立开发，它说明了项目进度和任何一个项目完成所需的时间量。甘特图说明了一个项目的终端要素和摘要要素的开始和结束日期之间的天数。"
