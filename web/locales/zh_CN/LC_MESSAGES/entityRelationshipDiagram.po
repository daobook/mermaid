"An entityâ€“relationship model (or ER model) describes interrelated things "
"of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is "
"composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and "
"specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of "
"those entity types). Wikipedia."
msgstr ""

#: ../../entityRelationshipDiagram.md:6
msgid ""
"Note that practitioners of ER modelling almost always refer to *entity "
"types* simply as *entities*.  For example the `CUSTOMER` entity *type* "
"would be referred to simply as the `CUSTOMER` entity.  This is so common "
"it would be inadvisable to do anything else, but technically an entity is"
" an abstract *instance* of an entity type, and this is what an ER diagram"
" shows - abstract instances, and the relationships between them.  This is"
" why entities are always named using singular nouns."

"Relationships between entities are represented by lines with end markers "

"ER diagrams can be used for various purposes, ranging from abstract "
"logical models devoid of any implementation details, through to physical "
"models of relational database tables.  It can be useful to include "
"attribute definitions on ER diagrams to aid comprehension of the purpose "
"and meaning of entities.  These do not necessarily need to be exhaustive;"
" often a small subset of attributes is enough.  Mermaid allows to be "
"defined in terms of their *type* and *name*."

#: ../../entityRelationshipDiagram.md:43
msgid ""
"When including attributes on ER diagrams, you must decide whether to "
"include foreign keys as attributes.  This probably depends on how closely"
" you are trying to represent relational table structures.  If your "
"diagram is a *logical* model which is not meant to imply a relational "
"implementation, then it is better to leave these out because the "
"associative relationships already convey the way that entities are "
"associated.  For example, a JSON data structure can implement a one-to-"
"many relationship without the need for foreign key properties, using "
"arrays.  Similarly an object-oriented programming language may use "
"pointers or references to collections.  Even for models that are intended"
" for relational implementation, you might decide that inclusion of "
"foreign key attributes duplicates information already portrayed by the "
"relationships, and does not add meaning to entities.  Ultimately, it's "
"your choice."

#: ../../entityRelationshipDiagram.md:68
msgid ""
"This statement can be read as *a property contains one or more rooms, and"
" a room is part of one and only one property*. You can see that the label"
" here is from the first entity's perspective: a property contains a room,"
" but a room does not contain a property.  When considered from the "
"perspective of the second entity, the equivalent label is usually very "
"easy to infer. (Some ER diagrams label relationships from both "
"perspectives, but this is not supported here, and is usually "
"superfluous)."

#: ../../entityRelationshipDiagram.md:70

"Only the `first-entity` part of a statement is mandatory.  This makes it "

"Relationships may be classified as either *identifying* or *non-"
"identifying* and these are rendered with either solid or dashed lines "

"not have independent existence without the other.  For example a firm "
"that insures people to drive cars might need to store data on `NAMED-"
"DRIVER`s. In modelling this we might start out by observing that a `CAR` "
"can be driven by many `PERSON` instances, and a `PERSON` can drive many "
"`CAR`s - both entities can exist without the other, so this is a non-"
"identifying relationship that we might specify in Mermaid as: `PERSON "
"}|..|{ CAR : \"driver\"`.  Note the two dots in the middle of the "
"relationship that will result in a dashed line being drawn between the "
"two entities.  But when this many-to-many relationship is resolved into "
"two one-to-many relationships, we observe that a `NAMED-DRIVER` cannot "
